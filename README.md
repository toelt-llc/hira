The HIRA project is involved with performing super-resolution on infrared images 

### Data 
* Grayscale pictures
* Lepton camera (60x80)
* Boson camera (256x320)
* 3 different sets of frames for a total of circa 3000k pictures
* 16-bit images
* Image range values between \[27476-23431\] (boson), \[31267-29707\] (lepton)

### Models
